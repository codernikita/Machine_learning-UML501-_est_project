<br><br>

## Introduction 
Sign language is a visual means of communication used by individuals with hearing impairments. This project aims to bridge the communication gap by developing an automated system that can understand and interpret sign language gestures. The system utilizes computer vision techniques and machine learning algorithms to recognize and translate these gestures into text or speech.

The Sign Language Recognition System consists of several components:

- **Data Collection:** A dataset of sign language gestures is collected, including various hand shapes.

- **Preprocessing:** The collected data is preprocessed to enhance the quality, remove noise, and extract relevant features.

- **Model Training:** Machine learning models, ie. convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is trained on the preprocessed data to learn the mapping between input gestures and their corresponding meanings.

- **Real-time Recognition:** The trained model is deployed in a real-time environment, where it takes video input and performs gesture recognition on the fly.
